# KaggleCompetitions

All my projects that I have done, while I was learning ML and DS.

### [1. Predicting House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)
#### Competition Description
Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

#### Practice Skills
* Creative feature engineering 
* Advanced regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting

### [2. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
#### Competition Description
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.

While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this challenge, we ask you to build a predictive model that answers the question: “what sorts of people were more likely to survive?” using passenger data (ie name, age, gender, socio-economic class, etc).

#### Practice Skills
* Data Visualization
* Preprocessing data
* Feature engineering
* Binary Classification 

### [3. MessangerBot](https://github.com/AjdinBajric)
The bot opens facebook.com and log in with your credentials. Then bot clicks on the first chat and sends the message that you enter in the script 10 times. (Edit number in the for loop). 

#### Dependencies
* Chrome driver
* Selenium

#### Practice Skills
* Web scraping
* Automating Web Applications with Selenium

### [4. What Sarajevo Drives?](https://www.olx.ba/pretraga?kategorija=18&stanje=&v_b=&od=&do=&kanton=9&godiste_min=&godiste_max=&kilometra-a_min=0&kilometra-a_max=0&konjskih-snaga_min=&konjskih-snaga_max=&kilovata-kw_min=&kilovata-kw_max=&kubikaza_min=&kubikaza_max=)
After a hazardous quality of the air in the past few days, I have decided to analyze "What kind of fuel do cars in Sarajevo run on?". There is almost 150.000 different kind of vehicles, according to the BIHAMK analysis from February 2019. 
Analysis has proven that traffic jams and the type of your car are the cause of a bad air quality in Sarajevo.
